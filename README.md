# My Emacs Configuration

I barely maintain this. It works for my use of Emacs these days. I
hope you find it useful.

# Credits and License

Special credit goes out to Jim Weirich, who sat down with me at a
small Ruby conference many years ago and showed me some really fun way
to use Emacs and Ruby. Rest in Peace, Jim, one of the kindest and most
brilliant people I've had the honor to know.

I have used and borrowed code from other people's Emacs repositories,
including:

* Phil Hagelberg, [Emacs Starter Kit](https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit)
* Jim Myhrberg, [.emacs.d](https://github.com/jimeh/.emacs.d)
* Steven Danna, [emacs-config](https://github.com/stevendanna/emacs-config)
* Jon-Michael Deldin, [ir-black-theme](https://github.com/jmdeldin/ir-black-theme.el)
* [Ryan Davis](https://github.com/zenspider) for `enh-ruby-mode` and more

Some of this code is specifically licensed under the GNU General
Public License. Some of it is not. I generally prefer more liberal
licenses such as the Apache 2.0 software license, but the GPLv3 is
fairly common among Emacs users. Except where specifically mentioned
the code in this repository is licensed under the GPLv3. If you are an
author of code I have used and do not like this license, please
contact me and I will call that out more clearly.
